cmsc143- Assignment 4 Peer Evaluation 

Eric unfortunately withdrew from the class which meant that I had to complete most of the project alone. We did meet one time to discuss ideas for the film. I ended up not using any of the ideas we came up with and created a film based on an entirely new idea. To put it short, I received no help from my partner and did this assignment independently.
