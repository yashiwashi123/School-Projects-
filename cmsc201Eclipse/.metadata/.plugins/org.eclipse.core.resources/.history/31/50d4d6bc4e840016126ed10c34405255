Point pt = new Point(2,3);
to:	
Point pt = new Point();
we	are	initializing	the	Point	pt	to	(0,0)	instead	of	(2,3).	First	we	get	the	initial	
coordinates	printed	giving us (0.0,	0.0) in the	console. We also get the distance from the origin(0,0) of the point: 0. 
This is calculated using the distanceFromOrigin method in the Point class. Then	the	code shifts	Point	pt	
to	the	right	by	calling	on	the	shiftRight(double)	method	in	the	Point	class	by	.7,	then	
prints	the	coordinates	giving	us	(0.7,	0.0). We also calculate the distance from the origin of the new coordinantes which equals 0.7. Then,	using shiftUp(double) also found in	
the	Point	class,	it	shifts	the	point	up	by	2.5	and	prints	the	current	information	giving	
us	(.07,	2.5)	in	the	console.	Directly	after	this,	we	get	the	result	of	the	method		
distanceFromOrigin()	which	calculates	the	distance	of	a point	from	the	origin	(0,0).	
This	result	Is	2.596150997149434	which	is	printed	in	the	console.	After,	using	the	
shiftLeft(double) method in	the	Point class, we shift the point	left by 10.2. The we	
print	the	point after it	has	been shifted: (-9.5,	2.5). Finally, we calculate the distance	
from	the	origin again and print	it onto	the	console. This distance form the origin is	
now	9.82344135219425.
